    "summary": "I was born on 22th July 1986 and was raised in Japan. I was interested in mathematics since I was in high school and I studied mathematics at university. I went on to graduate school as it was and got my master's degree in graph theory. After graduating from the graduate school, I began to work as the quants, I built and implemented a pricing model for financial derivative products using stochastic differential equations. Currently I quit the bank and work as a CTO at Handii. I love programming and mathematics, and I often spend my weekend reading books with my family at the cafe.",
